This chapter presents an interview with Richard Chen, director of business development of Occidental Petroleum Corporation in China, held in June 1980. Occidental Petroleum Corporation is an American firm that entered into collaborative arrangements with the Chinese on the exploration of China's energy resources. Occidental has met with considerable success in securing economic cooperative arrangements with the Chinese. Occidental reported in its annual report in 1979 that it received approval from China as a participant in the Phase 1 seismic program covering seven large offshore blocks in the South China Sea and Yellow Sea on which international oil companies were permitted to evaluate the hydrocarbon potential. The chapter examines Occidental's experiences in doing business with China, the nature and extent of its present involvement in China, how the company prepares for the negotiation, the factors that contributed to the success of such endeavors, and the advice that Occidental can give to others interested in China trade.}

abstract = {This paper investigates the impact of corporate governance and culture background on firms’ environmental performance and CSR disclosure from a global perspective. It provides evidence of a positive relationship between environmental performance and CSR disclosure, supporting the voluntary disclosure theory. We find that common internal corporate governance best practices (such as CEO non-duality, ESG committees and gender diversified boards) are associated with better environmental performance and more disclosure of CSR related information. Debt is an effective internal governance vehicle and positively affects firms’ environmental performance and CSR disclosure. Cross-listed firms perform better environmentally and disclose more CSR information. Firms residing in countries with stronger legal systems have less voluntary CSR disclosure, implying that external governance is functional and may partially serve as a substitute for internal governance. In terms of culture influence, we find that firms in countries with low power distance, individualism, femininity, high uncertainty avoidance, and long-term orientation perform better environmentally. Firms in low power distance, collectivistic, feminine, long-term oriented, high uncertainty avoidance and restrained countries disclose more CSR information.}

abstract = {This paper synthesizes the theoretical underpinnings of tournament models, reviews the extant empirical literature on the determinants and consequences of tournament incentives, critiques the findings and offers suggestions for future research. We synthesize findings from 63 empirical papers and find that several firm-level fundamental and corporate governance variables affect the structure of corporate tournaments. Our review of the consequences of tournament structure reveals that tournaments affect financial reporting and auditing as well as firm-level operational and capital market-based outcomes. This review reveals that the existing accounting and finance literature lacks a strong justification for why one theory rather than another is favored. Moreover, based on potential problems that may exist in empirical models, this review also offers some methodological implications for empirical tournament studies.}

abstract = {The study develops an empirical taxonomy of manufacturing back-shoring initiatives to the US, based on the drivers the location decision. Results identify six patterns of back-shoring, which highlight the importance of concurrently considering different theoretical lenses to interpret the phenomenon. Back-shoring initiatives are significantly driven by non-price related costs, which include the costs of governance. Institutional pressures coming from customers demanding country-of-origin branding and from political bodies are also important drivers, while the exploitation of distinctive resources that allow firms to compete in high-segment markets is less relevant. The study also highlights that back-shoring patterns are significantly related to within-border location advantages, such as state-level median wages, productivity, and innovation capacity.}

  abstract={Disruption in many supply chains has shown the vulnerability of global supply networks, especially resource-intensive ones, due to the simultaneous effects of pandemics and geopolitical crises. Reshoring and nearshoring strategies are the possible responses of manufacturing companies to disruptions in order to adapt to unforeseen events. The supply chain for the Italian ceramic sector, which is characterized by a high intensity of natural and energy resource consumption and a sourcing system with a high geopolitical risk, is examined in this study. The functional decomposition technique was used to analyze the supply chain; then, three scenarios were developed as potential remedies for the unexpected termination of Ukrainian plastic clay supply. The study also showed that complex issues require multifaceted analysis approaches, which is why a transdisciplinary approach was chosen. In addition, the analysis of the ceramic industry showed that nearshoring and reshoring strategies can reduce supply risk and have a positive impact on the environment. The study also showed how bringing extraction sources closer to factories significantly reduces CO 2 emissions to the atmosphere from transportation. The main contribution of this paper is the analysis of the complexity of supply chains in times of disruption, configuring reshoring and nearshoring options through transdisciplinarity.},

 abstract = {The Modigliani-Miller theorem on the irrelevancy of financial structure implicitly assumes that the market possesses full information about the activities of firms. If managers possess inside information,however, then the choice of a managerial incentive schedule and of a financial structure signals information to the market, and in competitive equilibrium the inferences drawn from the signals will be validated. One empirical implication of this theory is that in a cross section, the values of firms will rise with leverage, since increasing leverage increases the market's perception of value.},
